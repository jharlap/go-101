# Intro to Go Workshop

These materials are intended for an Intro to Go workshop that is suitable for
programmers who are comfortable with an object oriented programming language
and wish to learn Go. The workshop should take about 4 hours to run in a small
classroom setting (~12 students), giving everyone sufficient time to complete
each exercise.
